## Working with Vectors

1. Consider two numeric vectors p and q;

```
p<-c(2,4,6)
q<-c(3,5,7)
```
Use R to perform the following operations on p and q.

* Add `p` and `q`
* Subtract `p` from `q`
* multiply `p` by `q`
* divide `p` by `q`
* raise `p` to the power of `q`

2. Repeat (1) with `p<-c(4,8,5)` and `q<-c(3,2)`. Inspect any warnings or errors and examine how R handles arithmetic operations for vectors of different length.
